   <p>
     HTML (<span class="bold underline">H</span>yper<span class="bold underline">T</span>ext <span class="bold underline">M</span>arkup <span class=" bold underline">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used to structure a

   <h2 class="underline"> So what is HTML? </h2>
   <p>
     HTML is a <span class="bold">markup language</span> that defines the structure of your content. It
      conists of a series of <em>elements</em> which you use to enclose, or wrap
       different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. For
        example if we wanted a line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a pragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:

     alt="Anatomy of an html element" 
     width="500"
   /> 
   
   <p>The main parts of an HTML element are as follows:</p>
   <ol>
     <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the elements (e.g. p) wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets, This states where the element begins or starts to take effect. </li>
     <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends -In this case where the paragraph ends.</li>
     <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text</li>
     <li><strong>The element:</strong>The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together complete the element.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>
